                    Created in 1978, it took the world by storm becoming the most
                    widely-known controller in Nintendo History. Using a simple
                    design with a d-pad and four buttons it helped the controller
                    become widely successful with the public. It's use with the
                    incredibly popular Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
                    brought it to become easily recognizable with pop culture
                    and in the gaming community as a whole.
                </p>

                <h3>The Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The main purpose of the NES controller is to provide a
                    simple and easy to learn controller for the NES platform.
                    With just a d-pad and four other buttons it is simple for
                    newcomers to gaming when household videos games became
                    mainstream.
                </p>

                <h3>The Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The layout of the NES Controller is iconic in the gaming
                    community. With the D-pad on the left side, start and select
                    button in the middle, and two round buttons on the right it
                    became a simple and easy to learn controller.
                    <br /> The wire used to connect to the main console is a
                    proprietary piece of hardware. It uses a 4021 IC that
                    transmits what buttons have been pushed.

                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <h3>Has the NES controller changed at all from its original design</h3>
                <p>
                    While keeping the design of the original NES controller,
                    the new controller is wireless with a rail along the top,
                    so it can connect to a Nintendo Switch â€“ OLED Model or
                    Nintendo Switch console for charging.
                </p>

                <h3>Is the new NES controller the same one that was released for the NES Classic Edition?</h3>
                <p>
                    No, the NES Classic Edition controller is different from
                    the NES controller designed for use with Nintendo
                    Entertainment System - Nintendo Classicsâ€”the two are not
                    interchangeable.
                </p>

                <h3>Can the NES controller be used with other software besides NES games?</h3>
                <p>
                    The NES controller is designed for use with Nintendo
                    Entertainment System - Nintendo Classics games and is not
                    guaranteed to work with other software.
                </p>

                <h3>How can I buy an NES controller?</h3>
                <p>
                    The NES controller is available only as a set of two for
                    $59.99 (plus shipping). The controller set can be purchased
                    by users in the U.S. and Canada with an active, paid
                    Nintendo Switch Online membership. (Free trial users are
                    not eligible.)
                </p>

                <h4>Is this a limited time offer?</h4>
                <p>
                    No, the NES controller is not a limited-time offer.
                    However, the offer is only available once per Nintendo
                    Account.
                </p>

                <h5>Can additional people in my family membership order their own NES controller?</h5>
                <p>
                    Yes. Each member of a family membership can order up to
                    four NES controller sets, regardless of their age.

                    However, this offer is only available once per Nintendo
                    Account. For example, if someone with an individual
                    membership orders controller sets and then joins a family
                    membership, they will not be able to order an additional
                    controller set.

                <h3>Official Troubleshooting Guidelines</h3>
                <h4>Step 1: Ensure proper connection</h4>
                <p>Controller should be plugged into Port No. 1 on your system.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Disconnect your device</h4>
                <p>
                    Power off your system and disconnect your controller by
                    pressing the tabs on the connector that goes into the
                    console
                </p>

                <h4>Step 3: Check for physical damage</h4>
                <p>
                    Check for any visible damage on your controller and along
                    the cord. <br /> If any physical damage is found,
                    controller should be replaced. If no damage is present,
                    continue to step 4.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 4: Reconnect controller</h4>
                <p>
                    Reconnect your device into Port No. 1. If your device is
                    still not working, continue to step 5.
                </p>

                <h4>Step 5: Check another controller</h4>
                <p>
                    If you have another compatible controller, plug that
                    device into Port No. 1. If the new controller is also
                    faulty, this is indicative of an issue with the system.
